# OpenCDA Documentation

Welcome to the OpenCDA documentation. 

OpenCDA is a generalized open-source framework encapsulated with multi-resolution simulations for Cooperative Driving Automation research. This home page contains an index of the different sections in the documentation. 

* __Install OpenCDA.__ Please follow the [OpenCDA installation](OpenCDA_installation.md) to install the latest OpenCDA release.  
* __Use OpenCDA.__ This section instroduces the general workflow of [running scenarios](OpenCDA_examples.md) with OpenCDA.  
* __Available API.__ there is a handy [Python API reference](python_api.md) to look up the classes and methods available.  
 
OpenCDA is a work in prgress, we welcome your input and please visit out Github repo for latest release.
